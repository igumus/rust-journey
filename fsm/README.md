# fsm

Simple project to experiment FSM (Finite State Machines)

## Objectives
- TBD

## Quick Start

For turnstile:
```console
cargo run --bin turnstile
```

For Regex:
```console
cargo run --bin regex
```

## Examples

- Coin-Operated Turnstile

A turnstile, used to control access to subways and amusement park rides, is a gate with three rotating arms at waist height, one across the entryway. Initially the arms are locked, blocking the entry, preventing patrons from passing through. Depositing a coin or token in a slot on the turnstile unlocks the arms, allowing a single customer to push through. After the customer passes through, the arms are locked again until another coin is inserted.

- Basic Regex

Regular expressions provide a compact way to define a language that can be accepted by a finite-state machine. Regular expressions are used in the input to a scanner generator to define each token, and to define things like whitespace and comments that do not correspond to tokens, but must be recognized and ignored.
